## Features
This WebApp is a clone of the famous Social Media App --> [Instagram](https://instagram.com/) <br>
This is a very dynamic WebApp, because Users can create an account for using this app, to post photos, captions and comment on pictures.<br>
This App is different from other React-Instagram-Clones because, it's much more responsive than other clones, and also because uploading photos and captions is done using a much simpler Modal Button in this App.<br>
Since, it's also connected to Firebase Backend, the interaction and loading of posts and comments is much faster than any other apps, connected to other databases.<br>
This WebApp also uses MATERIAL UI to provide a sleek, dynamic and highly responsive forntend, for the User's ease of access.
